# Toolchain availability, templates, and tutorials  
{: #cd_about}  

Toolchains are available on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and Dedicated. You can use a template as a starting point to create a toolchain.
{:shortdesc}

## Toolchain availability on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public compared to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated
{: #public_and_dedicated}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public is an open-standards, cloud-based platform where you can build, run, and manage applications that are accessed by [http://cloud.ibm.com ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://cloud.ibm.com){:new_window}. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated provides the capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in a dedicated SoftLayer environment that is securely connected to both the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public environment and your network. Your company's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated environment might not contain the same tool integrations as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public site.

For source-code management and issue tracking, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public generally uses {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} (hosted by IBM and built on [GitLab Community Edition ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://about.gitlab.com/){:new_window}) or GitHub (github.com). {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated can also use github.com, but it generally uses {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} that is either installed by your company or managed by IBM.

{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} is available on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public in selected regions, and on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated. Toolchains differ depending on whether you use {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated.

Although toolchains are not currently available in all regions, you can configure your toolchain to deploy your apps across all regions. To learn more, try the [Deploy a secure web application across multiple regions tutorial](/docs/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-multi-region-webapp){: new_window}.

|:----------|:------------------------------|:------------------|
|Tool integrations 		|For a list of supported tool integrations, see [Configuring tool integrations](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-integrations){: new_window}. 		|The tool integrations that are available depend on how {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} was set up in your environment.			|

|Delivery pipeline deployment regions		|All {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public regions are available for Cloud Foundry deployment jobs. 		|The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated region is available. Other Dedicated or Local regions within the same customer account might also be available depending on how {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} was set up in your specific environment.		|
|Delivery pipeline deployment jobs		|All [job types](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-deliverypipeline_about#deliverypipeline_jobs) are available.		|Job types that depend on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services that are not installed in the Dedicated environment might not be available.	For example, container build and deploy job types might not be available in environments that do not have the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.	|

## Toolchain templates
{: #templates}

You can use a template as a starting point to [create a toolchain ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/create){: new_window}. Toolchain templates include specific sets of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

Your company's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated environment might not contain the same toolchain templates as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public site. Toolchain templates that are available on both {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated might contain a different set of tool integrations on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated.
{: note}

Some toolchain templates include tool integrations that are part of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your resource group or organization, when you click **Create** to create the toolchain, the service is automatically added with the selected free Lite plan. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/){:new_window}.

The "Develop and test microservices on Cloud Foundry" toolchain deploys an app with catalog and orders APIs that are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying the app, a no-cost Cloudant service instance is created. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/){:new_window}.

The predefined DevOps toolchain templates are recommended examples that solve real world scenarios and each contains a sample app.  You can use your own app by specifying your git repo when you create the toolchain from the template.
