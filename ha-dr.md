# High availability and disaster recovery
{: #ha-dr}

All {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} general availability (GA) services have a Service Level Agreement of 99.99% availability. {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} is a GA service that is offered in six regions: Dallas, Washington, Toronto, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Sydney, Osaka, and London. Each location has three different data centers for redundancy. The data for each location is kept in the three data centers near that location. If all the data centers in a location fail, the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service for that location becomes unavailable.

{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} is available only on the public cloud, but the tools that are used with {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} can run in dedicated or public cloud environments and in on-premises environments. 

See [ensure zero downtime](/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#zero-downtime) to learn more about the high availability and disaster recovery standards in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
