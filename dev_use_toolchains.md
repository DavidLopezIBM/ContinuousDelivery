# Developing with toolchains
{: #dev_with_toolchains}

Adopt a DevOps approach by using open toolchains in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.  Toolchains automate the development, deployment, and operations tasks. Toolchains are available on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}. You can use a template as a starting point to create a toolchain or you can create a custom toolchain.

To learn more, see [Toolchains](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains_about.html#toolchains_about).
