# About Continuous Delivery
{: #cd_overview}

With {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}, you can build, test, and deliver applications by using DevOps practices and industry-leading tools.
{:shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service supports your DevOps workflows:

 * You can create integrated DevOps open [toolchains](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_about){: new_window} to enable tool integrations that support your development, deployment, and operations tasks.

  A toolchain is an integrated set of tools that you can use to collaboratively develop, build, deploy, test, and manage applications and make operations repeatable and easier to manage. Toolchains can include open source tools, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, such as [{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}}](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-di_working){: new_window}, and third-party tools, such as GitHub, PagerDuty, and Slack. 
  
  {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} is available in the US South, United Kingdom, and Germany regions.

 * Deliver continuously by using automated [pipelines](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-deliverypipeline_about){: new_window}.

  Automate builds, unit tests, deployments, and more. Build, test, and deploy in a repeatable way with minimal human intervention. Be ready to release into production at any time.

 * Edit and push your code from anywhere by using the [web-based IDE](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-web_ide){: new_window}.

  Create, edit, run, and debug, and complete source-control tasks in GitHub. Seemlessly move from editing your code to deploying it to production. 
  
 * Collaborate with your team and manage your source code with a [Git repository (repos) and issue tracker](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-git_working#git_working){: new_window} that is hosted by IBM and built on GitLab Community Edition.

  Manage Git repos through fine-grained access controls that keep code secure. Review code and enhance collaboration through merge requests. Track issues and share ideas through the issue tracker. Document projects on the wiki system.
